# Bookmarklets and Tampermonkey userscripts

This repo has my scripts to sites that I have wanted to have some new features.
All scripts should work as either a bookmarklet or a Tampermonkey userscript.

---
## Reddit scripts

### removeFromAll.js

Makes filtering /r/all subreddits a little bit easier by
changing subreddit link default functionality to my custom function.

### removeLowScore.js

This is not that useful script but it will remove reddit
posts that have too low score.

### batchHide.js

This script adds all posts a hoverable area which will mark
the post to be removed when the user lifts the control key.

The hover areas will only be visible when user presses the Control
key.

### hideCommentTree.js

Script creates clickable areas on top of the comments that can be clicked to
hide the comment tree.

## Work script

### getCurrentTime.js

This script is just for my work. It helps to keep track of time during the work
day when I'm jumping between projects. The script will show as for now only how
much time I have used the current day, but I would like to expand it more.

This script doesn't work straight away because it is missing some information
for a reason.
