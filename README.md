# Bookmarklets and Tampermonkey userscripts

This repo has my scripts to sites that I have wanted to have some new features.
All scripts should work as either a bookmarklet or a Tampermonkey userscript.

## Remove scripts

All of these are meant for reddit.com.

removeFromAll.js: Makes filtering /r/all subreddits a little bit easier by
changing subreddit link default functionality to my custom function.

removeLowScore.js: This is not that useful script but it will remove reddit
posts that have too low score.

## Get current time

This script is just for my work. It helps to keep track of time during the work
day when I'm jumping between projects. The script will show as for now only how
much time I have used the current day, but I would like to expand it more.

This script doesn't work straight away because it is missing some information
for a reason.
